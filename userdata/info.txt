
About the folders "userdata" and "userdata_pub"
-----------------------------------------------

The folders "userdata" and "userdata_pub" contain various files that are unique
to your OIDplus installation. With a few exceptions (like the info.txt files),
the folder contents are safe from being accidentally changed or
deleted by SVN updates.

Generally speaking, everything inside these folders belongs to you,
and everything else belongs to OIDplus (and should not be changed!).


The folder "userdata"
---------------------

The folder "userdata" contains data from various plugins.
The access to this directory MUST be restricted,
because it can contain sensitive information like log files or
SQLite databases.
Therefore, please make sure that your webserver (e.g. Apache)
does not allow access to this directory.
If the access is not denied, please check .htaccess (for Apache),
nginx.conf (for Nginx) or web.config (for Microsoft IIS).

More information about the contents of the sub-folders
can be found in the info.txt file which is located in
each sub-folder.


The folder "userdata_pub"
-------------------------

The folder userdata_public/ can be used to store any kind of static
files that should be accessed through the web browser.
The access to this directory shall not be restricted.

Possible use cases:
- If you create an individual CSS file in userdata/style/oidplus_base.css
  (The CSS content will be processed by oidplus.min.css.php),
  and want to include individual graphics, then you can place the graphics in this directory.
- You can place documents in this directory, and link to them in OID descriptions
  (the "file attachments" or "documents and resources" plugins are recommended, though).


Tenants
-------

Multiple domains can use the same OIDplus installation but have different
`userdata/` and `userdata_pub/` directories. Therefore, simply create
a directory named `userdata/tenant/www.example.com` where `www.example.com` is
your host name.
Then, if the user visits this domain name, then the data inside
`userdata/tenant/www.example.com` will be chosen rather than `userdata/`.
Each domain can therefore have different database connections (or simply different
table prefixes), different resources (welcome page), etc.
