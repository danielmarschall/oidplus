
About the folder "userdata/resources"
-------------------------------------

This folder is used by the plugin "publicPages/500_resources"
(Section "Documents and resources")

Its contents will be merged with "res/" from the root directory.
"res/" contains the default resources which are part of the OIDplus
main installation (you shall not change or add anything to that folder),
while "userdata/resources" contains resources that you add yourself
(e.g. your impress, privacy statement, additional resources,
hyperlinks to your websites and products, etc.)

Valid contents:
- Subfolders
- *.html files
- *.link files (will be converted to a hyperlink in the menu on the left)
- *.url files (will be converted to a hyperlink in the menu on the left.
               No internationalization possible, therefore deprecated!)

Icons:
	You can define custom icons for any any file or folder by placing PNG files
	with the following file names:
	
	Assume the ressource file <filename>.html , then the icon files are:
	<filename>_big.png        (Big icon in the content-pane)
	<filename>_big$dede.png   (German-specific icon)
	<filename>_tree.png       (Icon in the tree view, 16x16)
	<filename>_tree$dede.png  (German-specific tree icon)
	
	The same applies for folders.

Redirections:
	In case a resource have been moved to another location,
	you can setup a redirection.
	Therefore, create a file res/redirect.ini (not recommended)
	or userdata/resources/redirect.ini (recommended) with a
	content like this:
			
		[Redirects]
		; Redirect a resource to an absolute URL
		Foobar/Test.html="http://example.com/test123.html"
		; Redirect a resource to a relative URL
		Foobar/Devices.html="/test123.html"	
		; Redirect a resource to a local "goto" file
		Foobar/Devices.html="?goto=oidplus:resources$Foobar/Manuals/Devices.html"	
	
Internationalization of *.html files:
	Title: The title is taken from the HTML headline.
	To create a file with multiple languages, create them like this:
		example.html      <-- this is the file in the default language ("enus" = English USA)
		example$dede.html <-- this is the file for German ("dede")
	Attention: The main file (without language code) needs to exist, so this is NOT possible:
		example$enus.html <-- DO NOT USE
		example$dede.html

Internationalization of *.link files:
	Title:
		.link files are like .url files, but they have an attribute for defining a title.
	The file format is like this:
		[Link]
		Title="Report a bug"
		URL="https://www.viathinksoft.com/thinkbug/thinkbug.php?id=97"
	To create an URL with multiple languages, create them like this:
		example.link      <-- this is the file in the default language ("enus" = English USA)
		example$dede.link <-- this is the file for German ("dede")
	Attention: The main file (without language code) needs to exist, so this is NOT possible:
		example$enus.link <-- DO NOT USE
		example$dede.link

Internationalization of *.url files:
	.url files are the normal files that can be created using Microsoft Windows.
	Internationalization of *.url files is not possible.
	Title:
		The title is taken from the file name.
	You need to create two entries which are always both visible in the menu,
	independent from the chosen language:
	- "Report a bug.url"
	- "Einen Fehler melden.url"

Internationalization of Folder names:
	By default, the folder title is the name of the directory.
	To change it, you can place a folder.ini with the following contents:
		[Folder]
		Title="Object Identifiers"
	For multilinguality, e.g. create folder$dede.ini for a German name
		[Folder]
		Title="Objekt-Bezeichner (OID)"
	Please note that the URL is always the same and exposes the real directory name:
		...?goto=oidplus:resources$Object Identifiers/
