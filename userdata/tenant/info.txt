
About the folder "userdata/tenant"
----------------------------------

A tenant uses the same files as the base system,
but it has its own userdata/ and userdata_pub/
environment. Hence, the tenant can have a completely
different page, because it can use different
designs and database tables due to the individual
base config.

If you want to use tenants, then you create
a directory for each tenant in this directory.

The subdirectory name needs to be like this:
Example: https://hosted.oidplus.com/abcdef/
becomes: userdata/tenant/hosted.oidplus.com__abcdef

This means: If the visitor vitis the page https://hosted.oidplus.com/abcdef/
and the directory userdata/tenant/hosted.oidplus.com__abcdef/ exists,
then this userdata directory will be chosen instead of userdata/.
If the visitor visits any other URL, then userdata/ will be chosen.
