# Contributing to the development of OIDplus 2.0

Currently, the main repository of OIDplus is
https://svn.viathinksoft.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/oidplus/

The GitHub repository located at https://github.com/danielmarschall/oidplus is only a mirror at the moment. (This might change in the future, but for now, SVN is the main source)

How you can contribute:

- Report bugs either as GitHub issue
  https://github.com/danielmarschall/oidplus/issues
  or via email to Daniel Marschall
  https://www.viathinksoft.com/contact/daniel-marschall
  if the report is confidential.

- If you have written code snippets or patches,
  you can either send them via email, bug tracker,
  or as pull-request.

- You can send GitHub pull-requests,
  but the changes will be applied manually to the SVN master repository,
  and then mirrored to GitHub.
  (Therefore, technically the pull-request will be ignored/rejected,
  even if the change was actually made)

- If you want to have write access to the SVN repository,
  please contact Daniel Marschall.

- If you have found a security vulnerability,
  please ONLY contact via email, not via a public bug tracker.

- If you have written plugins which are useful,
  we can include them in the official OIDplus release.
