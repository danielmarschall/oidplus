**VNag** (**V**iaThinkSoft **Nag**ios) is a framework for PHP which allows developing plugins for Nagios-compatible systems (e.g. Icinga2), following the [development guidelines](https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html "development guidelines").

The download package contains documentation, examples and many new plugins, e.g. to check WordPress installations.

Beside developing normal Nagios/Icinga plugins (PHP will be called via CLI), you can develop plugins which are additionally served over HTTP.

- The plugins can be shown via a HTTP-Demon (e.g. Apache) in user's browsers. Beside the output for Nagios (Summary, Verbose information, Performance data), user-defined HTML output can be added, e.g. to complete your Nagios output with more diagrams, pictures, etc. Only one code base is required!

- The web-output contains a hidden machine readable part, which can be read out with the "WebReader" plugin of VNag. The WebReader plugins reads the machine readable part and outputs the data in the output format which can be read by Nagios. This way, you can monitor things like WordPress version at systems where you have no shell access and/or without Nagios installed.

- It is also possible to create websites which only have a machine readable part (i.e. you include your VNag output in your existing website). This machine readable part can be optionally signed and/or encrypted.

Use-case diagrams
-----------------

1. [Simple case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmarschall/vnag/master/doc/vnag_model_1.png "Simple case"): Nagios/CLI checks an object
2. [Extended case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmarschall/vnag/master/doc/vnag_model_2.png "Extended case"): Nagios/CLI checks an object, and a user can additionally view the status in a web-browser
3. [More extended case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmarschall/vnag/master/doc/vnag_model_3.png "More extended case"): Nagios/CLI checks an object, a user can additionally view the status in a web-browser, and another Nagios/CLI instance can remotely access the output of the primary Nagios/CLI

Create your own plugins
-----------------------

To create your own plugins, you can look at the source codes of the existing plugins
to get inspiration and use them as templates.

Also, a small documentation is found in
[doc/Plugin_Development.md](https://github.com/danielmarschall/vnag/blob/master/doc/Plugin_Development.md).

If you have created useful plugins, we would be happy if you could share them with us!
