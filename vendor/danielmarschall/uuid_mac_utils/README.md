# UUID & MAC Utils by Daniel Marschall

The UUID & MAC Utils are a collection of PHP methods
for generating and interpreting UUIDs and MAC addresses.

An online version can be found at:

You can host these utilities yourself, or just use the methods
inside the *includes* directory for your own PHP projects.
