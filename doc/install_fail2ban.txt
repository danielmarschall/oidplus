
OIDPLUS FAIL2BAN INTEGRATION
============================

fail2ban can be used to watch your log files and
block network addresses that try to break into
your system using brute force.


Configuration
=============

In the OIDplus admin control panel, you need to set the following settings to "1" (enabled)
- log_failed_admin_logins
- log_failed_ra_logins

Also, please make sure that in the menu tree under "Plugins --> Logger" the plugin
"Simple Log File" is working (not marked in gray color).
If it is gray, please click "Logger" and look at the error message.
You probably need to set rights to the file "userdata/logs/oidplus.log" using chmod.


/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/vts-oidplus.conf (please adjust it to your needs!)
