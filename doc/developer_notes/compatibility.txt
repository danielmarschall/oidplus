
Requirements regarding compatibility

- The minimum required PHP version should be PHP 7.0, at least until the last old-stable Linux distro has lost its extended support.
- OIDplus should always be compatible with the latest available PHP version
- OIDplus must be compatible with all modern browsers
- Internet Explorer for public pages should be supported until the effort is low, e.g. just changing a few lines of codes, or including a polyfill.
- Internet Explorer for private pages (RA or admin login) is not so important, since only a small number of visitors will be registered users or admins.
- Search engines must be able to crawl all public content. This is the reason why a page contains static content (loaded in index.php) for the first navigation, instead of fetching everything through ajax.php.
