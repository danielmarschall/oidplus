Notes about the required PHP Version
====================================

OIDplus supports PHP 7.x and 8.x.

Reasons why we currently require at least PHP 7.0:
- Return values (e.g. "function foo(): array") (added 2020-04-06 at the database classes)
  Note: By removing these return values (e.g. removing ": array"), you *might* be
  able to run OIDplus with PHP lower than version 7.0 (not tested)

Currently we do NOT require 7.1, because some (old-)stable distros are still using PHP 7.0
(e.g. Debian 9 which has LTS support till May 2022).

Therefore, we commented out following features which would require PHP >=7.1:
- Nullable return values (e.g. "function foo(): ?array")
- void return value (e.g. "function foo(): void")
- private/protected/public consts
- In composer we cannot use the latest version of polyfill-mbstring,
  because this would require PHP 7.1
  Therefore in composer.json we write:
		"symfony/polyfill-mbstring": "<=1.19",
  the same thing with phpseclib which also now requires PHP 7.1:
		"phpseclib/phpseclib": "<=3.0.14"
  Once PHP 7.1 is OK, we can go with the latest versions again.
- In dev/vendor_update.sh we patch composer packages pulled from GitHub
  to achieve PHP 7.0 compat


Note: How to check the effective PHP version in composer?
	composer show --tree
