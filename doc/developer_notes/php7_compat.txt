Notes about the required PHP Version
====================================

OIDplus supports PHP 7.x and 8.x.

Reasons why we currently require at least PHP 7.0:
- Return values (e.g. "function foo(): array") (added 2020-04-06 at the database classes)
  Note: By removing these return values (e.g. removing ": array"), you *might* be
  able to run OIDplus with PHP lower than version 7.0 (not tested)

Currently we do NOT require 7.1, because some (old-)stable distros are still using PHP 7.0
(e.g. Debian 9 which has LTS support till May 2022).
Therefore we commented out following features which would require PHP 7.1:
- Nullable return values (e.g. "function foo(): ?array")
- void return value (e.g. "function foo(): void")
- private/protected/public consts
- In composer we cannot use the latest version of polyfill-mbstring,
  because this would require PHP 7.1
  Therefore in composer.json we write:
		"symfony/polyfill-mbstring": "<=1.19",
  Once PHP 7.1 is OK, we can go with the latest version again.

  Note: How to check the effective PHP version in composer?
	sudo aptitude install php7.0
	sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.0
	composer check-platform-reqs
