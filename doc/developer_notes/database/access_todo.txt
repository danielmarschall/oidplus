
Support for Microsoft Access Databases (mdb, accdb)
---------------------------------------------------

Tested with Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 (14.0)

The following things need to be addressed in order to make OIDplus compatible with Microsoft Access:

- When *.accdb file is opened in Microsoft Access, and the page is loaded, then you get the message "Table oidplus_config" is missing
	(Because the system thinks that the "select" Exception comes from a missing table rather than a locking issue)
	==> cannot reproduce on ELY2 system

- Look if there are some differences in the SQL language which affect us

	* like 'X%' comes 'X*' ?
		=> but in ADO it works?!
		select 'aa' like 'a%' ==> -1
		select 'aa' like 'a*' ==> 0

	* datetime? #24.12.1987#
		=> but in ADO it works with '24.12.1987' ???

=======================

The following things should be OK:

Test if everything works, including Unicode and boolean flags (checkboxes etc.)
    => Both tested, OK

For ODBC with MS Access, the following is important:
	correct:
	    $res2 = OIDplus::db()->query("...", array((int)$row['id']));
	wrong:
		$res2 = OIDplus::db()->query("...", array($row['id']));
	Same for booleans
	=> Everything was checked now

Make sure all database testcases work with PDO+ODBC and ODBC
	http://localhost/oidplus/dev/test_database_plugins.php
	The last result was:
		Database: OIDplusDatabaseConnectionPDO
		Detected slang: access
		...
		Transaction support: Not supported
	Everything else was OK

Weirdness in regards boolean fields (-1 vs 1)
	=> There is some weirdness. Sometimes '1' works and sometimes we need -1 ??
	   ... Depends if you use it in "set" or "where"
	   ... also depends if queried via PDO, ODBC or ADO ???!!

	In PHP ODBC, this works:
		$res = $db->query("select * from ###objects where id = 'test:1.1' and confidential = 1");
	but in ADO (database desktop tool) this does not work
		select * from objects where id = 'test:1.1' and confidential = 1
		instead I need
		select * from objects where id = 'test:1.1' and confidential = -1

	Works:
	select * from config where protected = -1
	update config set protected = -1
	update config set protected = 1
	update config set protected = '1'  // no type conflict!

	Does NOT work:
	select * from config where protected = '1'  // type conflict
	select * from config where protected = 1 // must be -1

	We handled that in ODBC/PDO via slang. But it is important that you do not use static "1" or "0" in queries. Always use prepared statements!
	=> RegEx to check it:
		\s+(privacy|confidential|longarc|standardized|well_known|protected|visible)\s*=\s*('1'|'0'|0|1|-1)
