INTERNET DRAFT          OID Information Protocol            October 2021


1  Introduction

   An Object Identifier (OID) is an extensively used identification
   mechanism jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC for naming any type
   of object with a globally unambiguous name.  OIDs provide a
   persistent identification of objects based on a hierarchical
   structure of Registration Authorities (RA), where each parent has an
   Object Identifier and allocates Object Identifiers to child nodes. 
   More information about Object Identifiers can be found in
   Recommendation ITU-T X.660 (2011) | ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012 [X660].

   There are a few methods of retrieving information about an OID, like:

   (A) Searching through web repositories like <http://www.oid-info.com>
   or <http://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/>.  This has the disadvantage
   that the information is usually not machine-readable without
   functionalities like an API.

   (B) Retrieving information using the Object Identifier Resolution
   System (ORS) as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.672 (2010) |
   ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 [X672].  This has the disadvantage that
   Registration Authorities need to include specific DNS Resource
   Records to their domains, and additionally, all RAs of the superior
   OIDs must implement the ORS.

   This document describes an additional method for retrieving
   information about OIDs, which is both human-readable and machine-
   readable.

   Three of many possible use-case scenarios are:

   (1) Many web-browsers and Operating Systems can handle ITU-T X.509
   certificates [X509] and usually contain a viewer application that
   shows the contents of these certificates.  Attributes that are
   unknown by the application are either only displayed by their OID, or
   hidden to avoid confusion to the user.  With OID-IP, the application
   could query the name of these unknown OIDs or even retrieve
   instructions on how the data described by this OID can be parsed and
   displayed.

   (2) Applications that handle SNMP (Simple Network Management
   Protocol) [RFC1157] might need information about additional MIB files
   or their OIDs.  OID-IP could aid these applications in gathering the
   required information.

   (3) In directory services like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol) [RFC4511], applications could query the name of attributes
   that are described by an OID the application doesn't know.

INTERNET DRAFT          OID Information Protocol            October 2021


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, "RA" is an abbreviation for "Registration
   Authority", "OID" is an abbreviation for "Object Identifier" and
   "OID-IP" is an abbreviation for "Object Identifier Information
   Protocol".

2  Request

   OID-IP is a text-based protocol.

   An OID-IP server listens on TCP port XXX for requests from OID-IP
   clients.  The OID-IP client makes a text request to the OID-IP
   server, then the OID-IP server replies with text content.  All
   requests are terminated with ASCII CR followed by ASCII LF.  The
   response contains multiple lines of text, separated by ASCII CR
   followed by ASCII LF.  The OID-IP server closes its connection as
   soon as the output is finished.  The closed TCP connection is the
   indication to the client that the response has been received.

   Alternatively to TCP port XXX, an OID-IP server can listen to the
   WHOIS TCP port 43.  Existing WHOIS servers can add the
   functionalities described in this document in addition to their usual
   operation, i.e. they may accept queries beginning with "oid:" as well
   as other types of queries.

   During the request, the client sends a query beginning with "oid:",
   followed by an OID in dot-notation, as defined in RFC 3061, section 2
   [RFC3061], but with the following differences:

   (1) The OID MAY contain a leading dot.

   (2) To query the root of the OID tree, the OID MUST be either missing
   or consisting only of a single dot.

   Examples of valid queries are:

       oid:
       oid:.
       oid:2.999
       oid:.2.999

   All OIDs MUST be interpreted as absolute OIDs.  Relative OIDs (e.g.
   relative to the OID of the Registration Authority operating the OID-

   IP service) are not allowed.

   The namespace identifier (i.e. "oid") MUST be written in lower-case.

2.1  Authentication Tokens

   Some organizations might not want to present their OID information
   (or part of it) to the public, e.g. for reasons like privacy or
   confidentiality.  Therefore, at the end of the query, the client can
   append case-sensitive, non-empty alphanumeric authentication tokens
   to control the display of confidential information.

   Each authentication token MUST be prepended by a dollar sign ("$").

   Examples of valid queries are:

       oid:2.999$firstToken
       oid:2.999$firstToken$secondToken

   Please note that authentication tokens are only weak protection.  For
   more information, see section 8 "Security Considerations".

2.2  Server Commands

   The client can send additional information to the server using
   "server commands".  These are similar to Authentication Tokens, with
   the difference that they contain an equal sign ("=") which divides
   the "name" from the "value".  Names and values are case-sensitive
   alphanumeric strings.  A request can contain multiple server commands
   which are each prepended by a dollar sign ("$").

   The usage of server commands is individual for each server and
   implementation.  This document defines/reserves the server-command
   "format" with the default value "text" which instructs the server to
   output in the text-based format described in this document.  Other
   values like "json", "xml", or "html" are subject to be defined by
   future specifications.

   The following request is an example of a valid query where the client
   sends a "format" command with the value "text" and an "antispam"
   command with the value "1":

       oid:2.999$format=text$antispam=1

2.3  Request ABNF Notation

   To define the query string, the following Augmented BNF definitions
   will be used.  They are based on the ABNF styles of RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

   query           = namespace ":" optional-oid *( "$" authtoken ) 
                     *( "$" cmdname "=" cmdval )

   namespace       = %x6F %x69 %x64  ; "oid"

   optional-oid    = [ "." ] [ oid ]

   oid             = unsigned-number *( "." unsigned-number )

   authtoken       = 1*( char-or-digit )

   cmdname         = 1*( char-or-digit )

   cmdval          = 1*( char-or-digit )

   digit           = %x30-39  ; 0-9

   nonzero-digit   = %x31-39  ; 1-9

   uppercase-char  = %x41-5A  ; A-Z

   lowercase-char  = %x61-7A  ; a-z

   char-or-digit   = uppercase-char / lowercase-char / digit

   unsigned-number = "0" / nonzero-digit *( digit )

3  Response

3.1  Format and Encoding

   (1) The response MUST be UTF-8 encoded (as defined in RFC 3629
   [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark (BOM).

   (2) The response contains multiple lines with field names and values,
   which MUST be separated by a double colon (":").  Whitespace
   characters after the double colon are allowed.

   (3) If possible, each line SHOULD be limited to 80 characters,
   including the field name, double colon, value, and whitespaces.

   (4) Field names and values MUST be treated case-sensitive.

INTERNET DRAFT          OID Information Protocol            October 2021


   (5) If a value needs to be split into multiple lines, e.g. if the
   line would exceed the length limit, the same field name including
   double colon MUST be repeated at the beginning of the next line.

   (6) If an attribute has multiple values (e.g. multiple Unicode
   labels, alternative email addresses, etc.), each value MUST be
   written in a new line with the same field name.

   (7) Lines with the same field name SHALL be kept together.

   (8) Comment lines MUST start with a percent sign ("%") at the
   beginning of a line, without prepending whitespaces.  They MUST NOT
   be evaluated by machines (except for signature validation, as
   mentioned in section 3.3 "Digital Signature").

3.2  Structure

   A response consists of sections, which SHOULD be separated by at
   least one empty line and/or comment line.

   This document specifies the following sections (which SHALL stay in
   this order):

   (1) Query-Section which contains the request and the result.  This
   section MUST start with the field "query".

   (2) Object-Section which contains information about the OID.  This
   section MUST start with the field "object".

   (3) RA-Section which contains information about the current
   Registration Authority.  This section MUST start with the field "ra".

   (4) Optional RA-Sections containing information about RAs that were
   previously in charge of managing the OID.

   The OID-IP service MAY define additional sections after any of these
   sections, but the Query-Section MUST be the first section in the
   response.

3.2.1  Query-Section (Information about Query and Result)

   This section MUST always be present and MUST start with the field
   "query".  It MUST be the first section in the response.

   Possible fields are:

   (1) "query" MUST be present and contain the request of the client
   (beginning with the namespace identifier and double colon, i.e.

   "oid:").  Canonization or sanitation (like removing a leading dot)
   SHOULD NOT be applied at this step.  Authentication tokens SHOULD be
   omitted, though.

   (2) "result" MUST be present and SHALL be one of the following
   values:

       "Found" means that the OID-IP service can verify that the
       requested OID exists.  The following sections will contain
       information about this OID.

       "Not found; superior object found" means that the OID-IP service
       cannot verify that the requested OID exists, or it denies that
       the OID exists (e.g. because it is confidential).  However, the
       OID-IP service knows a superior OID which does exist.  The
       following sections will contain information about that superior
       OID instead.

       "Not found" means that the OID-IP service cannot verify that the
       requested OID exists, or it denies that the OID exists (e.g.
       because it is confidential).  Additionally, the OID-IP service
       does not have information about any superior OID, or their
       existence is also denied.

       "Service error" means that an internal error occurred, or that
       the system is in maintenance mode.  The client should try again
       later.

   (3) "distance" SHOULD be present if it is applicable in the requested
   namespace (it is always applicable for OIDs) and if the result is
   "Not found; superior object found".  A distance of 1 means that the
   direct parent was found.  A distance of 2 means that the grand-parent
   was found, etc.

   (4) "message" SHOULD be present if the result is "Service error".  It
   contains a message explaining why the service is not available (e.g.
   displaying an error message).  It MUST NOT be present if the result
   has a different value.

   The OID-IP service SHOULD NOT add additional fields to this section.

3.2.2  Object-Section (Information about the OID)

   This section MUST be present if the result is "Found" or "Not found;
   superior object found".  It MUST start with the field "object".  It
   MUST NOT be present if the result is "Not found" or "Service error".

   Possible fields are:

INTERNET DRAFT          OID Information Protocol            October 2021


   (1) "object" contains the OID in dot-notation, prepended by the
   namespace identifier and double colon ("oid:").  This field MUST be
   present.

   (2) "status" MUST be present and SHALL be one of the following
   values:

       "Information available" means that information about the OID is
       fully available.

       "Information partially available" means that part of the
       information about the OID is not available.  Possible reasons
       could be that part of the information is redacted due to
       confidentiality, or the OID-IP service only knows basic
       information, while the full information can be found somewhere
       else (e.g. at a referred OID-IP service).  The field "attribute"
       MAY be used with the value "confidential".

       "Information unavailable" means that the information about the
       OID is missing, redacted due to confidentiality, or otherwise
       unavailable.  The field "attribute" MAY be used with the value
       "confidential".

   (3) "name" (OPTIONAL) contains the name of the OID.  It SHOULD be as
   short as possible.

   (4) "description" (OPTIONAL) contains a short description of the OID.
    The description SHOULD only be a single sentence.

   (5) "information" (OPTIONAL) contains additional information, e.g.
   Management Information Base (MIB) definitions.

   (6) "url" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a URL (as
   defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]) leading to more information about the
   OID.

   (7) "asn1-notation" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains one
   or more possible notations in the ASN.1 syntax, as defined in
   Recommendation ITU-T X.680 (2015) | ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015, clause 32.3
   [X680], e.g. {joint-iso-itu-t(2) example(999)}.

       Note: A line-break, to break up lines that are too long, as
       defined in section 3.1 ("Format and Encoding") SHOULD be used. 
       This is no problem because multiple ASN.1 notations can be
       distinguished by their opening curly bracket and their closing
       curly bracket.

   (8) "iri-notation" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains one

   or more possible notations in the OID-IRI syntax, as defined in
   Recommendation ITU-T X.680 (2015) | ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015, clause 34.3
   [X680] (but without quotation marks), e.g. /Joint-ISO-ITU-T/Example.

       Note: A line-break, to break up lines which are too long, as
       defined in section 3.1 ("Format and Encoding") SHALL NOT be used,
       otherwise, it would be ambiguous if the line-break was used to
       shorten the line, or if the line-break indicates a new value in
       case multiple OID-IRI notations are supplied.

   (9) "identifier" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains an
   alphanumeric identifier ("NameForm") as defined in Recommendation
   ITU-T X.680 (2015) | ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015, clause 12.3 [X680].

   (10) "standardized-id" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains
   an alphanumeric identifier that has a standardized "NameForm", i.e.
   in ASN.1 notation, it can be written without its associated number. 
   See more information in Recommendation ITU-T X.680 (2015) | ISO/IEC
   8824-1:2015, clause 32.7 [X680].

   (11) "unicode-label" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a
   Non-integer Unicode label, as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.680
   (2015) | ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015, clause 12.27 [X680].

   (12) "long-arc" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a Non-
   integer Unicode label that can be used as the first identifier in an
   OID Internationalized Resource Identifier (OID-IRI), shortening it. 
   More information can be found in Recommendation ITU-T X.660 (2011) |
   ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012, clause 3.5.8 [X660].

   (13) "oidip-service" (OPTIONAL) contains an IP address or hostname of
   a system that offers an OID-IP service that can supply information
   about the OID and/or its subordinate OIDs, followed by a double-colon
   (:) and a port number.  If the result is "Found" (i.e. the OID is
   existing in the local database), then the information "oidip-service"
   is only informational; its existence is most likely a hint that
   subordinate OIDs will be found at that OID-IP server.  If the result
   is "Not found; superior object found", then the client SHOULD query
   the referred OID-IP server to receive more information about the OID.
    See more information in section 4 "Referral".

   (14) "attribute" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains
   attributes of the OID.  An attribute MUST be one of the following
   values:

       "confidential" means that information about the OID or part of it
       is confidential.

       "draft" means that the allocation of the OID is not yet official
       and the information is subject to change without notice.  This
       includes deletion and relocation.

       "frozen" means that no more child OIDs can be created under this
       OID, e.g. because the RA has stopped operating, but the existing
       child OIDs stay valid.

       "leaf" means that no child OIDs can be allocated under this OID. 
       The field "subordinate" SHALL therefore not be present.

       "no-identifiers" means that the RA is not allocating alphanumeric
       identifiers.

       "no-unicode-labels" means that the RA is not allocating Non-
       integer Unicode labels.

       "retired" means that the OID is withdrawn, revoked, retired,
       expired, etc.  Please consult Recommendation ITU-T X.660 (2011) |
       ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012 [X660] for more information about such cases.

   (15) "parent" (OPTIONAL) contains the OID of the nearest known parent
   OID, prepended by namespace identifier and double colon, i.e. "oid:".
    It MAY be followed by additional human-readable information, e.g. a
   description or a list of ASN.1 identifiers.  There SHALL be at least
   1 whitespace in between.

   (16) "subordinate" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a
   list of subordinate OIDs, prepended by namespace identifier and
   double colon, i.e. "oid:".  It MAY be followed by additional human-
   readable information, e.g. a description or a list of ASN.1
   identifiers.  There SHALL be at least 1 whitespace in between.

   (17) "created" (OPTIONAL) contains the date and time (as specified in
   section 3.4 "Date/Time Format") when the OID was first allocated by
   the RA of the superior OID.

   (18) "updated" (OPTIONAL) contains the date and time (as specified in
   section 3.4 "Date/Time Format") when the OID information was last
   updated.

   Additional fields can be defined by the OID-IP service.  The field
   names SHALL only consist of the lower-case letters "a..z", hyphens
   ("-"), and numbers, and SHOULD be written in the English language. 
   The field name MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen and a hyphen MUST
   NOT be followed by another hyphen.

3.2.3  RA-Section (Information about the Current RA)

   This section MUST NOT be present if the result is "Not found" or
   "Service error", otherwise it MAY be present.  If it is present, it
   MUST start with the field "ra".

   Possible fields are:

   (1) "ra" contains a general name of the RA, like the name of a
   person, the name of a group, or the name of an organization.  This
   field MUST be present.

   (2) "ra-status" MUST be present and SHALL be one of the following
   values:

       "Information available" means that information about this RA is
       fully available.

       "Information partially available" means that part of the
       information is not available.  A possible reason could be that
       part of the information is redacted due to confidentiality.  The
       field "attribute" MAY be used with the value "confidential".

       "Information unavailable" means that the data is missing (if the
       OID-IP service only knows the name of the RA and nothing else),
       redacted due to confidentiality, or otherwise unavailable.  The
       field "attribute" MAY be used with the value "confidential".

   (3) "ra-contact-name" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains
   the name of a person responsible for the allocation of subordinate
   OIDs, in case "ra" is a group or organization.

   (4) "ra-address" (OPTIONAL) contains the physical location of the RA.
    While a fully qualified postal address is recommended, the field can
   also just contain a rough location like city and country name, state
   and country name, or just the country name, etc.  The name of the
   country SHOULD always be present.

   (5) "ra-phone" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a
   landline phone number of the Registration Authority.  It SHOULD be
   written in the international number format specified in
   Recommendation ITU-T E.164 (2010) [E164], e.g. +1 206 555 0100.

   (6) "ra-mobile" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a mobile
   phone number of the Registration Authority.  It SHOULD be written in
   the international number format specified in Recommendation ITU-T
   E.164 (2010) [E164], e.g. +1 206 555 0100.

   number of the Registration Authority.  It SHOULD be written in the
   international number format specified in Recommendation ITU-T E.164
   (2010) [E164], e.g. +1 206 555 0100.

   (8) "ra-email" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains an email
   address of the Registration Authority.

   (9) "ra-url" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains a URL (as
   defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]) leading to more information about the
   RA (usually the website of the RA).

   (10) "ra-attribute" (OPTIONAL, multiple values allowed) contains
   attributes of the RA.  An attribute MUST be one of the following
   values:

       "confidential" means that the information about the RA or part of
       it is confidential.

       "retired" means that the RA is defunct.  If this attribute is set
       to the current RA, then the OID MUST have the attribute "frozen"
       (until the responsibility is transferred to a non-defunct RA, or
       until the current RA becomes active again).

   (11) "ra-created" (OPTIONAL) contains the date and time (as specified
   in section 3.4 "Date/Time Format") when the RA was created/registered
   in the database.

   (12) "ra-updated" (OPTIONAL) contains the date and time (as specified
   in section 3.4 "Date/Time Format") when the RA information was last
   modified.

   Additional fields can be defined by the OID-IP service, but they MUST
   begin with "ra-".  The field names SHALL only consist of the lower-
   case letters "a..z", hyphens ("-"), and numbers, and SHOULD be
   written in the English language.  The field name MUST NOT begin or
   end with a hyphen and a hyphen MUST NOT be followed by another
   hyphen.

3.2.4  Sections for Previous Registration Authorities

   To optionally display information about RAs that were previously in
   charge of managing the OID, a new section per RA can be added with
   the following field name prefixes:

   "ra-" is the prefix of the current Registration Authority.

   "ra1-" is the prefix of the first RA.  It is the very first person or

   company to whom the OID was allocated by the RA of the superior OID.
   "ra2-" is the prefix of the second RA, after the responsibility has
   been transferred. etc.

   The definition of these sections is identical to the definition of
   the RA-Section (described in section 3.2.3 "RA-Section"), just with a
   different prefix.

   The history does not need to be complete, e.g. it is no problem to
   only serve information about the first and the current RA, or only
   serve information about the current RA.

3.3  Digital Signature

   If integrity/authenticity is required, the whole response can be
   signed, e.g. by using S/MIME, RSA, or PGP.  This document does not
   describe a mechanism for detecting which signature method was used. 
   The creation and verification of the signature are therefore
   implementation-specific and no interoperability regarding signature
   creation and validation is given at this time.

   Depending on the signature method being used, various things need to
   be appended and/or prepended to the response.  These additional lines
   MUST be prepended by a percent sign ("%") to avoid that an
   application confuses these additional lines (e.g. lines belonging to
   a PGP header, as defined in RFC 4880 [RFC4880]) with parts of the
   actual OID-IP response.

3.4  Date/Time Format

   Date/Time references SHALL be formatted as described in
   section 3.4.1.

   If parts of the date/time reference are uncertain, then they SHOULD
   be omitted until the date/time reference has the highest correctness.

   Examples of valid date/time references can be found in section 3.4.2.

3.4.1  Date/Time Format ABNF Notation

   To define the format of a Date/Time reference, the following
   Augmented BNF definitions will be used.  They are based on the ABNF

   date-time = year [ "-" month [ "-" day [ " " time ] ] ]

   year      = 4*4DIGIT

   month     = ( "0" %x31-39 ) /
               ( "1" %x30-32 )      ; 01-12

   day       = ( "0" %x31-39 ) /
               ( "1" %x30-39 ) /
               ( "2" %x30-39 ) /
               ( "3" %x30-31 ) /    ; 01-31

   time      = hour ":" minute [ ":" second ] [ " " timezone ]

   hour      = ( "0" %x30-39 ) /
               ( "1" %x30-39 ) /
               ( "2" %x30-33 )      ; 00-23

   minute    = %x30-35 DIGIT        ; 00-59

4  Referral

   By using the field "oidip-service", the OID-IP service can instruct
   the client to query another OID-IP service that might have more
   information about the requested OID.

   If Registration Authorities maintain up-to-date OID-IP service
   references of their OID delegations, it is possible to automatically
   retrieve information about any OID.

   Example: OID "2.999" is owned by Registration Authority "A",
   operating an OID-IP service at "a.example.com".

   Registration Authority "A" allocated OID "2.999.1000" to Registration
   Authority "B" who is operating an OID-IP service at "b.example.com".

   The client asks a.example.com for information about OID
   "2.999.1000.1" and should receive the following reply:

       query:          oid:2.999.1000.1
       result:         Not found; superior object found
       distance:       1

       object:         oid:2.999.1000
       status:         Information available
       name:           Company "B"
       oidip-service:  b.example.com:XXX

       ra:             "B"
       ra-status:      Information unavailable

   The client is now aware that "a.example.com" only knows OID
   "2.999.1000", and that there is a reference to another OID-IP service
   located at "b.example.com".  So, the client should then accordingly
   query "b.example.com", asking for information about OID
   "2.999.1000.1":

       query:          oid:2.999.1000.1
       result:         Found

       object:         oid:2.999.1000.1
       status:         Information available
       name:           Example OID 1

       ra:             "B"

6  Alternative Namespaces

   This document describes the retrieval of information about OIDs using
   the OID-IP protocol.  In addition to the OID namespace, the methods
   described in this document can also be applied to other namespaces
   like "uuid", "isbn", "gtin" etc.

   Following things need to be considered if alternative namespaces are
   implemented:

   (1) The request MUST be UTF-8 encoded (as defined in RFC 3629
   [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark (BOM).

   (2) The namespace SHALL be a namespace identifier (NID) as defined in
   RFC 8141 [RFC8141].

   (3) The namespace identifier SHALL be written in lower-case (this is
   already defined in section 2 "Request").

   (4) If available, a formal URN namespace identifier (as defined in
   RFC 8141, section 5.1 [RFC8141]) SHOULD be used, e.g. "uuid" should
   be used instead of "guid".

   (5) If things like "Owner", "Creator", "Manager", "Administrator",
   etc., are relevant to the identifiers in the namespace, then the RA-
   section as described in section 3.2.3 SHALL be used, even though the
   word "Registration Authority" might not be appropriate in the
   terminology of the namespace.

   (6) The namespace-specific identifier MUST NOT contain dollar signs
   ("$"), because section 2.1 "Authentication Tokens" defines them as a
   separator for authentication tokens.

   (7) The namespace-specific identifier MUST be treated case-sensitive
   if the namespace distinguishes between lower-case and upper-case.

   (8) Fields that can only be used in the OID namespace (e.g. "unicode-
   label") MUST NOT be used for other namespaces.

6.1  Example: UUID Namespace

   The following example shows the retrieval of information about
   Universally Unique Identifiers (e.g. UUIDs used by the Microsoft
   Common Object Model, also known as GUIDs).  The UUID namespace has no
   hierarchical structure, which means that the OID-IP service can only
   respond with the result "Found", "Not found" or "Service error" and
   the fields "parent" and "subordinate" cannot be used.

   Request:

       uuid:b4bfcc3a-db2c-424c-b029-7fe99a87c641

   Response:

       query:        uuid:b4bfcc3a-db2c-424c-b029-7fe99a87c641
       result:       Found

       object:       uuid:b4bfcc3a-db2c-424c-b029-7fe99a87c641
       status:       Information available
       name:         Desktop
       information:  GUID can be used in file dialogs as "Custom Place".

   More information about UUIDs can be found in Recommendation ITU-T
   X.667 (2012) | ISO/IEC 9834-8:2014 [X667].

7  Internationalization Considerations

   This document specifies that the request and response MUST be UTF-8
   encoded (as defined in RFC 3629 [RFC3629]), without Byte-Order-Mark
   (BOM).

   The OID-IP service can define additional field names, but they SHOULD
   be written in the English language so that there is consistency with
   the field names defined in this document.

INTERNET DRAFT          OID Information Protocol            October 2021


8  Security Considerations

   (1) The knowledge of existence or information about some OIDs could
   be considered confidential.  In this case, the OID-IP service can
   either deny the existence of the requested OID (by setting the result
   to "Not found") or redact information in the Object-Section, as
   defined in section 3.2.2 "Object-Section".

   (2) Registration Authorities might demand that their data is kept
   confidential, or at least be partially redacted to increase privacy
   or as a measurement against spam.  In this case, the OID-IP service
   can redact information in the RA-Section, as defined in section 3.2.3
   "RA-Section".

   (3) The OID-IP service can decide if confidential material is omitted
   or shown, based on authentication mechanisms like white-listing
   client IP addresses or by using authentication tokens supplied by the
   client, as defined in section 2.1 "Authentication Tokens".

   (4) The usage of authentication tokens is not recommended if the
   traffic between client and server is transmitted through an untrusted
   network, because the OID-IP protocol is not encrypted.

   (5) Authentication tokens must have a sufficient length and
   complexity to avoid successful brute force attacks, or the OID-IP
   service must limit the number of requests per time.

   (6) The OID-IP protocol itself has no mechanism for verifying the
   integrity of data received.  Due to this fact, the information should
   not be trusted if it is transmitted through an untrusted network.  If
   integrity/authenticity is required, the OID-IP response can be
   signed, as described in section 3.3 "Digital Signature".  However,
   this document does not describe a mechanism for detecting which
