<p>The registration of your OIDplus instance has various advantages:</p><!-- please keep in sync with res/OIDplus/privacy_documentation.html -->

<ul>
	<li>The public key of your OIDplus instance will be published to the ViaThinkSoft web directory so that users can check the integrity of your data (e.g. signed OID-IP/OID-WHOIS requests).</li>
	<li>Since the 31-bit System ID can have hash conflicts, ViaThinkSoft will make sure that the System ID is only used by your OIDplus instance (it will force other OIDplus systems with the same system ID to change their IDs).</li>
	<li>ViaThinkSoft can acknowledge the system name, administrator email address, and OID root arcs. Therefore, your OIDplus instance can be found using Referral WHOIS.</li>
	<li>You can optionally enable the automatic publishing of your public OID information to the repository oid-info.com.</li>
	<li>If your root OID(s) are approved by ViaThinkSoft (it will be manually verified that the root OIDs belong to you), a feature will be unlocked which can be used to compare and import OIDs from oid-info.com into this OIDplus instance.</li>
	<li>Your OIDplus version will be reported to ViaThinkSoft. If a severe bug or security vulnerability is affecting your OIDplus instance, ViaThinkSoft can warn you via email.</li>
	<li>The directory service will automatically create an X.509 security certificate for you (NOT an SSL certificate!) which can be used for various verifications.</li>
</ul>
